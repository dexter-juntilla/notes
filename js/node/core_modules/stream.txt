### DATA EVENTS ###
###################

data
	stream.emit("data", new Buffer("foo"));

	You use a data event to indicate that a new piece of stream data, referred to as a chunk, is available.

end
	stream.emit("end");

	Once a stream sends all of its data, it should emit a single end event. Once the end event is emitted, no further data events should be emitted.

close
	stream.emit("close"); 

	The close event is used to indicate that the underlying source of the stream data has been closed. For example, streams that read data from a file emit a close event when the file descriptor is closed.

error
	stream.emit("error", new Error("Something went wrong!")); 

	error events are used to indicate that a problem occurred with the data stream. For example, streams that read from files emit an error event if the backing file does not exist.
