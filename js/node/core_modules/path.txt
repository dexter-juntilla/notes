path
	The path module exports functions that provide useful string transformations common when working with the file system.

	path.normalize(str)
		This function fixes up slashes to be OS specific, takes care of . and .. in the path, and also removes duplicate slashes.

	path.join([str1], [str2], ...)
		This function joins any number of paths together, taking into account the operating system.

	path.dirname, basename, and extname
		These functions are three of the most useful functions in the path module. path.dirname gives you the directory portion of a specific path string (OS independent), and path.basename gives you the name of the file. path.extname gives you the file extension.

	path.sep
		path separator used by the os

	path.delimiter
		PATH environment variable separator ie. ':' or ';'

	path.relative(from, to); determine the relative path from one directory to another
