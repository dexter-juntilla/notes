Supported options to pass to the morgan function (logger() in the previous example) are as follows:
 - format: A string with an output format; see the upcoming list of token string and predefined formats.
 - stream: The output stream to use defaults to stdout, but could be anything else, such as a file or another stream.
 - buffer: The number of milliseconds for the buffer interval; defaults to 1000ms if not set or not a number.
 - immediate: Boolean value that, when set to true, makes the logger (morgan) write log lines on request instead of response.

The following are the available format string parameters or tokens:
 - :req[header] (e.g., :req[Accept])
 - :res[header] (e.g., :res[Content-Length])
 - :http-version
 - :response-time
 - :remote-addr
 - :date
 - :method
 - :url
 - :referrer
 - :user-agent
 - :status

The following are the predefined formats/tokens that come with Morgan:
 - combined: Same as :remote-addr - :remote-user [:date] ":method :url
HTTP/:http-version" :status :res[content-length] ":referrer" ":user-agent"
 - common: Same as :remote-addr - :remote-user [:date] ":method :url
HTTP/:http-version" :status :res[content-length]
 - short: Same as :remote-addr :remote-user :method :url
HTTP/:http-version :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
 - tiny: Same as :method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
 - dev: Short and colored development output with response statuses, same as :method
:url :status :response-time ms - :res[content-length]



var logger = require('morgan');

app.use(logger(':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms'));
